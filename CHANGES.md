4. **Task #23: Implemented retry logic for API calls**
   - Added a retry mechanism with a maximum of 3 retries for network-related errors
   - Added specific handling for different types of API errors (authentication, rate limits, etc.)

## Improvements Made

### 1. Error Handling Improvements

The RAG chain now has more robust error handling with:
- Input validation for hand_type, player_value, and dealer_upcard parameters
- Specific error handling for different types of errors (network, authentication, rate limits)
- User-friendly error messages that provide clear guidance
- Better handling for context retrieval failures
- Validation for the query expansion response

Example of improved error handling:
```python
# Before
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in get_response: {e}")
    return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}. Please check your API key and try again."

# After
except (ConnectionError, TimeoutError) as e:
    # Network-related errors - retry
    retry_count += 1
    logging.warning(f"Network error (attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries}): {e}")
    if retry_count >= max_retries:
        return "I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge service. Please check your internet connection and try again later."
    
except Exception as e:
    # For other errors, log and return a user-friendly message
    error_type = type(e).__name__
    logging.error(f"Error in get_response ({error_type}): {e}")
    
    if "API key" in str(e) or "authentication" in str(e).lower():
        return "Authentication error. Please check your API key configuration."
    elif "rate limit" in str(e).lower() or "quota" in str(e).lower():
        return "I've reached my usage limit. Please try again in a few minutes."
    else:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred. Please try a different question or try again later. Error type: {error_type}"
```

### 2. Strategy Table Improvements

The strategy table now has:
- Comprehensive docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Type validation for all input parameters
- Range validation for player_value based on the hand type
- Validation for dealer_upcard to ensure it's within the valid range
- Special handling for edge cases like very low hands and busts

Example of improved strategy table:
```python
# Before
def get_action(hand_type: str, player_value: int, dealer_upcard: int) -> str:
    table = {
        'hard': hard_table,
        'soft': soft_table,
        'pair': pairs_table
    }.get(hand_type.lower(), hard_table)  # Default to hard
    actions = table.get(player_value, {})
    dealer_key = dealer_upcard if dealer_upcard <= 10 else 11  # Ace as 11
    return actions.get(dealer_key, 'H')  # Default hit

# After
def get_action(hand_type: str, player_value: int, dealer_upcard: int) -> str:
    """
    Get the optimal blackjack action based on hand type, player value, and dealer upcard.
    
    Args:
        hand_type: Type of hand - "hard", "soft", or "pair"
        player_value: Player's hand total (2-21)
        dealer_upcard: Dealer's visible card (2-11, where 11 represents Ace)
        
    Returns:
        Action code: 'H' (Hit), 'S' (Stand), 'D' (Double), 'Ds' (Double if allowed, else Stand), 'P' (Split)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs are invalid or out of range
    """
    # Validate inputs
    if not isinstance(hand_type, str):
        raise ValueError(f"Hand type must be a string, got {type(hand_type).__name__}")
    
    # ... additional validation and edge case handling ...
    
    return actions.get(dealer_key, 'H')
```

### 3. Testing

A test script (`test_changes.py`) was created to verify the changes:
- Tests for the renamed file
- Tests for the strategy table with valid inputs and edge cases
- Tests for the input validation in the RAG chain

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the changes are working as expected.

## Next Steps

Based on the remaining tasks in the improvement list, here are suggested next steps:

### High Priority
1. **Add input validation for user inputs in the Streamlit app (task #18)**
   - Validate user inputs in the Streamlit app to prevent invalid inputs
   - Add clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. **Implement graceful fallbacks when API calls fail (task #20)**
   - Add fallback mechanisms for when API calls fail
   - Consider caching previous responses for common queries

3. **Add proper logging throughout the application (task #21)**
   - Implement a consistent logging strategy across all modules
   - Add log rotation and log levels

### Medium Priority
1. **Create a dedicated config module (task #2)**
   - Centralize configuration settings in a dedicated module
   - Move hardcoded values to configuration files

2. **Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and methods (task #10)**
   - Add comprehensive docstrings following a standard format (e.g., Google style)
   - Document parameters, return values, and exceptions

3. **Create unit tests for the strategy table logic (task #25)**
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for the strategy table
   - Add test coverage reporting

### Lower Priority
1. **Refactor the project to follow a more modular architecture (task #1)**
   - Implement a more modular architecture (e.g., MVC pattern)
   - Create separate modules for different functionalities

2. **Optimize the vector store creation process (task #33)**
   - Improve the performance of the vector store creation
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

3. **Improve the mobile responsiveness of the Streamlit UI (task #41)**
   - Make the UI more responsive on mobile devices
   - Add more interactive elements

## Conclusion

The completed tasks have significantly improved the robustness and reliability of the Grok21 Blackjack Strategy Helper. The application now handles errors more gracefully, provides better user feedback, and is more resilient to edge cases. The test script ensures that these improvements are working as expected.

By following the suggested next steps, the application can be further enhanced to provide an even better user experience and maintainability.
